# pico-web-mouse

### WIP

A web server with the Raspberry pico W that allows you to control your mouse from a web site. You can connect the Raspberry to your target device, then connect to the server using your phone, and move in the web site as a virtual mouse connected to your real device.

Add a `settings.toml` file with your WIFI credentials

```
# Setting these variables will automatically connect board to WiFi on boot
CIRCUITPY_WIFI_SSID="YOUR_SSID"
CIRCUITPY_WIFI_PASSWORD="YOUR_PASSWORD"
```
